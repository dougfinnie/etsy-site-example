I love creating whimsical and fun projects that are as enjoyable to make as they are to wear.\r\n\r\nI have been designing knitting and crochet patterns for over 15 years, and I have worked with many UK knitting magazines, such as The Knitter, Simply Knitting, Knit Now, and Let’s Knit. Collaborated with some amazing yarn companies, Scheepjes, King Cole, and Eden Cottage Yarns to name a few.\r\n\r\nI often say that two designers share a studio in my head, one loves whimsy, bright palettes and fun elements, most seen in my children’s designs. The other, likes to focus on the bringing some calm and self-care, utilising more muted tones for my sock and accessories patterns.\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect from my patterns:\r\nMy patterns are well written and easy to follow, with clear instructions and charts. Patterns are tech edited and sometimes test knit to ensure accuracy. I also share tutorials and tips on my website and newsletter, to help you improve your knitting and crochet skills.\r\n\r\nYou can browse and buy my patterns from my Ravelry store or my website.
