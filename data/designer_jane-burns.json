I’m Jane.\r\n\r\nI create beautiful designs for knitters and crocheters who love to work with gorgeous yarns. I help them to make fun and playful projects that are an indulgence to work on and a treat to wear.\r\n\r\nMy designs are perfect for those who love to create intricate looking projects without lots of complicated instructions. I believe that crafting should be a relaxing pleasure. It’s my mission to bring clear and easy to execute designs, which are accessible for newer knitters and provide instant gratification for the more experienced.\r\n\r\nI’ve designed patterns for a variety of publications, including The Knitter, Let’s Knit, Knit Now, Knit Today, Art of Knitting and Love Knitting for Baby. I’ve also produced a mini collection for Eden Cottage Yarns as well as co-authoring Crochet Infinity Scarves: 8 Simple Infinity Scarves to Crochet. My slightly quirkier work has been featured on television alongside Harry Hill.\r\n\r\nWhen I’m not designing my latest socks or playing with beautiful hand dyed yarns from the dyers I love, you’ll find me knitting quietly in the corner of a comedy club, or at a live gig (I usually leave the knitting at home in this case!) As a result, you’ll find my work is influenced a lot by music, my other main passion.\r\n\r\nI share my life with my husband, Doug,  my three children and my mini schnauzer Bertie.\r\n\r\nIf you’re ready to join in the fun, you can check out my tutorials or join my newsletter to [download your free gift  here][1].\r\n\r\n***You can buy my patterns from my [Ravelry store, here][2]***\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss commission a design, I would love to hear from you drop me a line.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to become part of the [Jane Burns Designs community][3], please join the group and say hello….\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://eepurl.com/bDxbrH\r\n  [2]: http://www.ravelry.com/stores/knitting-image--designs-by-jane-burns\r\n  [3]: http://www.ravelry.com/groups/jane-burns-designs","notes_html":"\n<p>Hello.
