The other, likes to focus on the bringing some calm and self-care, utilising more muted tones for my sock and accessories patterns.\r\n\r\nWhat you can expect from my patterns:\r\nMy patterns are well written and easy to follow, with clear instructions and charts. Patterns are tech edited and sometimes test knit to ensure accuracy. I also share tutorials and tips on my website and newsletter, to help you improve your knitting and crochet skills.\r\n\r\nYou can browse and buy my patterns from my Ravelry store or my website.
