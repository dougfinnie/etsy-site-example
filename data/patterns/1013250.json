My slightly quirkier work has been featured on television alongside Harry Hill.\r\n\r\nWhen I’m not designing my latest socks or playing with beautiful hand dyed yarns from the dyers I love, you’ll find me knitting quietly in the corner of a comedy club, or at a live gig (I usually leave the knitting at home in this case!)
